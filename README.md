Domain - HealthCare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)

RCM is the process that hospital use to manage the financial aspects, from time patient schedules appointment till time provider gets paid

Breakdown-

	1. Patient visits:
	Details collected… insurance details
	This ensures provider who will pay for service (insurance company, or patient or both)
	
	2. Services are provided

	3. Billing happens: hospital creates bill

	4. Claims are reviewed: insurance company review bill to make sure it follows rule
		They might pay full, partial or decline
		
	5. Payments and followups: 
	Once insurance company pays, it is check and followup will patient in case of partial payment
	
	6. Tracking and improvement:
	RCM ensures the hospital can provide quality Care Quality Care while also staying financially healthy.
	
	
	As part of RCM we have two main aspects:
	- Accounts Receivable (AR)
	- Accounts Payable (AP)

	Patient paying is often a risk
	
	Scenarios when patient has to pay: 
	Low Insurance: these insurance provider put lot of burden on patient 
	
	2 objectives of AR:
	- Bring cash (money)
	- Also minimize collection period

	Probability of collecting your full amount decreases with time…
	- 93% of money due 30 days old …
	- 85% of money due 60 days old …
	- 73% of money due 90 days old …  


	KPI (Key Performance Indicator): to measure AR and set benchmarks
	
	1. AR >90 days
	Older than 90 days / total AR
	Benchmark=10%, id exceed this business handle then
	
	2. Days in AR
	Suppose 1 million USD in 100 days => 10000 USD per day
	400 USD AR => 40days pending
